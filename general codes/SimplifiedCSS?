A cool trick to simplify things... in my opinion is to have one CSS file that modifies multiple, this will give the website a uniform feel and simplify your life

i.e for your landingPage and other elements, you can have one CSS file modifiying all your user pages
and for your form pages you can have one CSS modifying all your forms

all now you have to do is write extra html codes and Vuala...-> the CSS will modify all your html codes as uniformly as possible , remember to link it with
the <link rel="stylesheet" href="your file location"> tag (goes btwn the head and body tags)
